# Tic Tac Toe in C

This is my attempt at writing Tic Tac Toe in C. This is my first time working in C, so don't expect it to be perfect.

## Installation

Fork the project and compile it using any regular old C compiler, then run the project.

## Contributing

Feel free to send pull requests, change the code, use it yourself, or correct me on where I went wrong; I need all the help I can get!
